# epi-UQ
For conducting uncertainty quantifications on models with large output. Applied to epidemiological models.

This repository is the hub for Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) for this project. We cover emulation and history matching for large outputs. This repository covers emulation and history matching for large numbers of outputs. We use principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of outputs for emulation purposes and use rotation of the bases' to ensure the reproducibility of the observation for history matching. We also conduct history matching when data is supplied for each wave.
