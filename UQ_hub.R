# This script is the hub for Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) for this project.
# We cover emulation and history matching for large outputs.
# 
# Prior to using this hub, the user must have supplied a script in 
# '~/models/"model-name".R' that gives the following when sourced:
#   X: n x p size matrix. These are design point inputs.
#   Y: n x q size matrix. These are design point outputs
#   X.valid: n' x p size matrix. These are validation point inputs.
#   Y.valid: n' x q size matrix. These are validation point outputs.
#   var.names: p length vector. Names of all input variables.
#   lower.bounds: p length vector. Lower bound for each input variable.
#   upper.bounds: p length vector. Upper bound for each input variable.
#   z: q length vector. Observation for purposes of history matching.
#   obs_err: q length vector. Observation error for purposes of history matching and constraining basis vectors.
#   model_disc: q length vector. Model discrepancy for purposes of history matching and constraining basis vectors.
# Alternatively one can load these in via '~/models/"model-name".Rdata'

# This script covers emulation and history matching for large numbers of 
# outputs. We use principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of 
# outputs for emulation purposes and use rotation of the bases' to ensure the 
# reproducibility of the observation for history matching. We also conduct 
# history matching when data is supplied for each wave.

# install packages needed and load them in

### EMULATION

rotated.pca$VarExp
# if necessary reduce/increase number of principal components (no.pcs) if 
# required. looking for lowest number of pcs that explain desired amount of 
# variance.
rotated.pca$recon_err
# also look at the reconstruction error for each principal component added
# (MSE).

# set no.pcs in 'hmwave' to be the maximum of the choices for rotated.pca$VarExp
# and rotated.pca$recon_err

# History match: am using initial model runs as the inputs/outputs for this wave
